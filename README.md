# 2021-S1-2-C | Virtual Reality Rendition of the DREAMS Telescope | ANU Techlauncher

**For more info and documentation, see our [landing page](https://sites.google.com/view/2021-s2-techlauncher-dreams/home)**

This repo is used for both semester 1 and 2 of our project.

### Overview
Our project aims to create a virtual experience where users can interact with a rendition of several different telescopes located at the Siding Spring Observatory NSW. Users will be able to view and operate a simulated version of these telescopes, and explore the surrounding facility.

The main purpose of our project is for education and outreach. It will be valuable for anyone looking to learn about astronomy, or engineers to examine the operation and installation of these telescopes.

The experience is built for the Oculus Quest 2 virtual reality (VR) headset, but there is also a standalone version for PC with support for keyboard or gamepad controls. We aim to port the application to additional platforms in the future.
